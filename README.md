# CS-465_Full-Stack-1

**Architecture**

1. Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
  - Throughout this project, I used several different types and styles of frontend development surrounding the MEAN stack. The use of Javascript, static and Express HTML, and SPA architecuture all played very different and key roles in this project. We started out with static HTML content and utilized a lot of recurring code that formatted the lists, headers, footers, and several other formatting options. This helped to contextualize and realize the symmetry between many different styles of pages and how this one worked with the Express page hosted on localhost:3000.
