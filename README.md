# CS-465_Full-Stack-1

**Architecture**

1. Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
  - Throughout this project, I used several different types and styles of frontend development surrounding the MEAN stack. The use of Javascript, static and Express HTML, and SPA architecuture all played very different and key roles in this project. We started out with static HTML content and utilized a lot of recurring code that formatted the lists, headers, footers, and several other formatting options. This helped to contextualize and realize the symmetry between many different styles of pages and how this one worked with the Express page hosted on localhost:3000. Alternatively, it is important to mention the work done on the Single-Page Application with Angular, and how it used a different format all together. We still utilzied most of the existing architecture from the Express site, but the single page made for an entirely different experience. With the SPA, all information needed to be loaded on initiation and functioned dependently on the Express site being live. This is in stark contrast to the Express site which did not require the Angular site to be live at all. From an administrative standpoint, it was easy to see why the SPA architecture was more feasible and adaptible for the continued work on the express site. The Angular site made it so that adding, editing, and updating trips and information was all in a singular location with easy access after authentication.


2. Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
  - There are several reasons to use a NoSQL MongoDB Database. One of the most influential reasons in this project was that MongoDB uses Javascript which is very maleable and easily applicable in the MEAN stack. What is cool about this use of javascript, is that it essentially allows for us the developers to use JavaScript at all sides of the application, front-end, back-end, and database. This made many of the functional calls much smoother and streamlined as well, while also cutting down on code length due to syntax requirements. Additionally, the lack of necessity on schema, ease of indexing, and the flexibility of the parameters involved were important factors.




**Functionality**

1. How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

2. Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

 **Testing**

1. Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
